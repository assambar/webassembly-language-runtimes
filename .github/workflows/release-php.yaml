# Note that for this workflow to be triggered, the tag needs to be
# created of the form `php/<version>+<buildinfo>`, where <buildinfo>
# by convention is YYYYMMDD-<short-sha> (short SHA can be calculated
# with `git rev-parse --short HEAD`). An example of a tag following
# the convention that triggers automation would be
# `php/7.3.33+20221123-8dfe8b9`.
